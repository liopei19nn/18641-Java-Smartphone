Read me for understanding how to run project 1 unit 4 

You could see readMe.txt and class diagram.jpg in their own project folder!!

Run as guided below please!

1. load lip_project1_Client and lip_project2_Server to Eclipse.

2. Open the Server first, open lip_project2_Server server package, and run Server.java

3. Open multiple Client. Single and multiple client are all support here. Open lip_project1_Client project, client package, and run the SocketClient.java. If you want to 
test multiple client situation, just run it several times and operate in multiple terminals in Eclipse.

4. If you run the client, you could type “Number” as guided in terminal display for operating. Do NOT type the exact name of operation, because I have defined it illegal and the program will ask you to type “legal NUMBER” until you input a legal one.

5. You could choose “1” for upload, “2” for configure, and “0” for quit at main option list. However, if you are in the middle of any of this procedure, you could not quit by type in “0”. 
You could just terminate the client by shut down its corresponding terminal, no stream close issues will bugs you because I have handled some of them.

6. There is no options for shut down server to type in. If you want to shut down the server, please just shut down its corresponding terminal.

7. Shut down server did not make client shut down accordingly, and continue operate on client will make you get lots of exceptions. You could just ignore them and shut down its terminal.
